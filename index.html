	This is my personal <a href="{{ "/blog" | prepend: site.url }}">blog</a> and <a href="{{ "/projects" | prepend: site.url }}">project space</a>. From time to time I write articles about tech stuff (mostly Node.js and Javascript). You can also find the <a href="{{ "/slides" | prepend: site.url }}">slides from my talks</a> as well as documentation for my open source projects.
	<br /><br />
	Right now, I'm focused on node.js scaling and performance as well as Best Practice approaches to module development.
